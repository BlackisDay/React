            Throughout my life I was told that I was an ambitious person. That I had a great passion for technology.
            I enjoyed learning about new technologies. I also enjoyed working in teams. I ended up starting from scratch working as a team member in restaurants, to leading a team.
            Now I want to use the knowledge,skills, and bring them into the tech industry.
